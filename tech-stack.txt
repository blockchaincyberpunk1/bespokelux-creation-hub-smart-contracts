BespokeLux Creation Hub: Personalized Luxury Goods Manufacturing
Personalized Luxury Goods Manufacturing: A platform connecting customers with luxury goods manufacturers for personalized products, using smart contracts to manage orders and payments.

1. Blockchain Technology
Ethereum: The most popular blockchain for deploying smart contracts, ideal for managing transactions and agreements in a decentralized manner.
Solidity: Programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.
Hardhat: For development, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
MetaMask: A crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, for handling transactions directly from the web browser.
2. Backend Development
Node.js: Efficient and scalable server-side JavaScript runtime, excellent for handling asynchronous calls and integrating with the Ethereum blockchain.
Express.js: Minimalist web framework for Node.js to handle server-side logic.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store user data and transaction logs that do not need to be on-chain.
3. Frontend Development
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its efficiency and reusable components.
Web3.js: A collection of libraries to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.
4. Smart Contracts and Blockchain Interactions
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): For decentralized storage, useful for storing large files such as images of personalized products, not suited to blockchain storage due to cost and speed.
OpenZeppelin: For secure smart contract libraries to help build robust contracts.
5. Payment Integration
Stripe or PayPal API: For handling fiat currency transactions if necessary, alongside cryptocurrency transactions.
6. DevOps
Docker: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
GitHub Actions or Jenkins: For continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.
AWS or DigitalOcean: Reliable cloud hosting services to deploy and manage the application's operations.
7. Security and Compliance
SSL/TLS: Secure the data in transit.
OAuth 2.0: For secure authenticated access to the API.
Auditing Smart Contracts: Use security firms specializing in smart contracts to audit the contracts before going live.
